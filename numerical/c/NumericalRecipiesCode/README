watch out for these:

Run make in lib folder before you run it in any other folders since those will typically depend on the lib .o files. But in most cases, the .o files will already be there so this might not be necessary.

None of the .o files from various solutions (lib, ch2, etc) should have the same names. This is because we write all .o files to a flat folder.

When moving between Windows and linux, take care to either not generate or delete the .o files in the obj directory. The executables produced by windows are not compatible with linux and vice versa.

Starting ch05, I now have debug versions of each function that print out what the function is doing in every iteration. These, in conjunction with additional resources linked in the print statements should be used to get a deep understanding of the code.
