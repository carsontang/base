/**************************************************
Given a matrix a[1..n][1..n], this routine replaces it by the LU decomposition of a rowwise permutation of itself. 
a and n are input. a is output, arranged as in equation (2.3.14); 
indx[1..n] is an output vector that records the row permutation effected by the partial pivoting; 
d is output as Â±1 depending on whether the number of row interchanges was even or odd, respectively. 
This routine is used in combination with lubksb to solve linear equations or invert a matrix.
